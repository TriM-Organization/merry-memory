# Merry Memory





## Summary
A converter that converts **BDX** file to its corresponding **mcworld** description.



## Meaning
Actually speaking, **Merry Memory** is a manga, which you can find in **Bilibili Manga**.

Although this is a manga that describe the loves between boys, 
I still very suggest it, because it soothes my heart, just as gentle as prose.

The rising sun illuminated the earth. The swaying breeze caressed my face.
